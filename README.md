# ALPC-Example
An example of a client and server using Windows' ALPC functions to send and receive data.
###
## Purpose
This example will hopefully help devlopers who want to use ALPC for communication get a basic understanding of the process. There are only a few code samples around that show how to use ALPC and for some reason many of them are high level language implementations. This example uses [Process Hacker's](https://github.com/processhacker/processhacker) (ntlpcapi.h) ALPC header file for function and structs definitions.
